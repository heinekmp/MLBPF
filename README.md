Multilevel Bootstrap Particle Filter

These are C source codes for experimental multilevel bootstrap particle filter algorithm. There are purpose specific implementations for two applications: BIG_DATA and ODE_MODEL. The first involves a one dimensional hidden Markov model with high dimensional noisy observation. The second, ODE_MODEL involves a Euler-Bernoulli beam model where one attempts to infer the unknow location of a known load (mass) on Euler-Bernoulli beam, based on the observed deflections of the beam.
